# Configuration Example: NetBackup 10.0-10.4 with Explicit API Version 3.0
#
# Use this configuration when:
# - Running NetBackup 10.0, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, or 10.4
# - You want to explicitly specify API version 3.0
# - You're maintaining legacy NetBackup environments
# - You want to skip automatic version detection for faster startup
#
# NetBackup Version: 10.0 - 10.4
# API Version: 3.0
# Detection: Disabled (explicit version)

server:
    host: "localhost"
    port: "2112"
    uri: "/metrics"
    scrapingInterval: "1h"  # Time window for job collection (e.g., "30m", "1h", "2h")
    logName: "log/nbu-exporter.log"

nbuserver:
    scheme: "https"
    uri: "/netbackup"
    domain: "my.domain"
    domainType: "NT"
    host: "nbu10-legacy.my.domain"  # NetBackup 10.0-10.4 master server
    port: "1556"
    apiVersion: "3.0"  # Explicit API version for NetBackup 10.0-10.4
    apiKey: "your-api-key-here"  # Generate from NetBackup UI
    contentType: "application/vnd.netbackup+json; version=3.0"
    insecureSkipVerify: false  # Set to true only for testing environments

# Legacy Support:
# - API version 3.0 is supported for backward compatibility
# - Core metrics (jobs, storage) work the same across all API versions
# - Some advanced features may not be available in older API versions
# - Consider upgrading to NetBackup 10.5+ for latest features

# Notes:
# - Replace "your-api-key-here" with your actual NetBackup API key
# - Replace "nbu10-legacy.my.domain" with your NetBackup master server hostname
# - Adjust scrapingInterval based on your monitoring needs
# - Keep insecureSkipVerify: false for production environments
