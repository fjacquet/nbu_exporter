# Configuration Example: NetBackup 10.5 with Explicit API Version 12.0
#
# Use this configuration when:
# - Running NetBackup 10.5
# - You want to explicitly specify API version 12.0
# - You want backward compatibility with existing configurations
# - You want to skip automatic version detection for faster startup
#
# NetBackup Version: 10.5
# API Version: 12.0
# Detection: Disabled (explicit version)

server:
    host: "localhost"
    port: "2112"
    uri: "/metrics"
    scrapingInterval: "1h"  # Time window for job collection (e.g., "30m", "1h", "2h")
    logName: "log/nbu-exporter.log"

nbuserver:
    scheme: "https"
    uri: "/netbackup"
    domain: "my.domain"
    domainType: "NT"
    host: "nbu10-master.my.domain"  # NetBackup 10.5 master server
    port: "1556"
    apiVersion: "12.0"  # Explicit API version for NetBackup 10.5
    apiKey: "your-api-key-here"  # Generate from NetBackup UI
    contentType: "application/vnd.netbackup+json; version=3.0"
    insecureSkipVerify: false  # Set to true only for testing environments

# Backward Compatibility:
# - This configuration format is compatible with previous exporter versions
# - NetBackup 11.0 also supports API 12.0 for backward compatibility
# - If you upgrade to NetBackup 11.0, this configuration will continue to work
# - To use new NetBackup 11.0 features, update apiVersion to "13.0"

# Notes:
# - Replace "your-api-key-here" with your actual NetBackup API key
# - Replace "nbu10-master.my.domain" with your NetBackup master server hostname
# - Adjust scrapingInterval based on your monitoring needs
# - Keep insecureSkipVerify: false for production environments
